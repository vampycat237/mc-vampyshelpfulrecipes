<p>helpful little recipes that make the game a little bit easier!</p>

<p>This datapack is intended to be somewhat balanced (it doesn't let you craft anything super powerful with like nothing), but it will in fact make the game easier.</p>

<p>The main goals of this datapack include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adding logical and (hopefully) balanced crafting recipes for non-craftable dungeon loot items (like horse armor and saddles)</li>
<li>Making all "Block of &lt;Resource&gt;" blocks able to be recycled/un-crafted so they can be used as storage like most <a href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Block_of_Mineral">Blocks of Minerals.</a></li>
<li>Adding a few harmless but helpful recipes for aesthetic items like dyes (craft green dye from dried kelp)</li>
</ul>

<p>All recipes can be found on the wiki linked up on the top, though they should also appear in the recipe book and with any recipe viewer type mod like REI.</p>

<p>Note: This datapack is for <strong>1.18.2</strong>. It might work on other versions, but I cannot guarantee that as it was designed for and only tested on 1.18.2. I may consider adding support for older and newer versions, please feel free to request or add support for a particular game version if you like! (It has to be one that supports datapacks though, so no earlier than 1.13)</p>
